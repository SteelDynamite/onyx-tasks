# Tech Debt Documents

1. Read `.agents/docs/TECHDEBT.md` completely, then search `.agents/docs/techdebt/` for the same deficiency.
2. Record only a known deficiency the project knowingly leaves unresolved. Active fixes belong in features; recurring fixes belong in lessons or runbooks.
3. Update an existing record when it covers the debt. Otherwise create a uniquely named kebab-case file with `priority: p3` unless its relative urgency deliberately differs.
4. Use `status: backlog` until retirement work starts and `in-progress` only while it is underway. State the present deficiency, impact, deferral tradeoff, and observable retirement condition.
5. Validate the result against `TECHDEBT.md`. Delete the record when its retirement condition is met, preserving durable outcomes where appropriate.

Use this complete shape. Replace comments; do not retain them.
