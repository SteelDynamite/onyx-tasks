# Runbook Documents

1. Read `.agents/docs/RUNBOOKS.md` completely, then search `.agents/docs/runbooks/` for an existing procedure.
2. Document work a person or agent actually performs; automatic behavior belongs in source or a decision document.
3. Update the existing procedure when it applies. Otherwise use a uniquely named kebab-case file.
4. Make steps executable, verification observable, and troubleshooting specific to likely failures.
5. Validate the result against `RUNBOOKS.md`.

Use this complete shape. Replace comments; do not retain them.
