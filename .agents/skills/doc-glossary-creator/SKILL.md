# Glossary Documents

1. Read `.agents/docs/GLOSSARY.md` completely, then search `.agents/docs/glossary/` for the term, aliases, and overlapping concepts.
2. Update an existing definition instead of creating a synonym or duplicate. Create a uniquely named kebab-case file only for a distinct term.
3. Define the current project-specific meaning, distinctions that prevent ambiguity, and relevant relationships. Omit generic dictionary definitions.
4. Validate the result against `GLOSSARY.md`.

Use this complete shape. Replace the comment; do not retain it.
